# Jekyll in a Docker Container

> But this has been done. Why not `docker run jekyll/jekyll`?

- I wanted two images, one for easy CLI (`bretfisher/jekyll`) and one for
easy local server for dev with sane defaults (`bretfisher/jekyll-serve`), which I use 90% of time
- So you can start any Jekyll server with `docker-compose up`
- I wanted to dev on a local jekyll site w/o having jekyll installed on my host OS
- I wanted it to be as easy as possible to start
- I wanted current alpine, ruby, and jekyll

> So, this does that.

Note [I have courses on Docker (including a Lecture on Jekyll in Docker)](https://www.bretfisher.com/courses).

## Docker Images

| Image | Purpose | Example |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| [bretfisher/jekyll](https://hub.docker.com/r/bretfisher/jekyll/) | Runs Jekyll by default with no options, good for general CLI commands | `docker run -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll new .` |
| [bretfisher/jekyll-serve](https://hub.docker.com/r/bretfisher/jekyll-serve/) | Runs Jekyll serve with sane defaults, good for local Jekyll site dev | `docker run -p 8080:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve` |

## Getting Started

Creating a site:

```shell
cd to empty directory
docker run -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll new .
```

Start a local server with sane defaults listening on port 8080:

```shell
cd dir/of/your/jekyll/site
docker run -p 8080:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```

That's it!

Details: it will mount your current path into the containers `/site`, `bundle install` before running `jekyll serve` to , serve it at `http://<docker-host>:8080`.

To make this even easier, copy `docker-compose.yml` [from this repo](https://github.com/BretFisher/jekyll-serve/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to your jekyll site root. Then you'll only need to:

```shell
cd dir/of/your/jekyll/site
docker-compose up
```

## Known issues

1. `webrick` errors during startup.

    - As of April 2021, this image uses Ruby 3.0, and Jekyll is still on 4.2 (released 12/2020). Jekyll 4.2 doesn't have `webrick` listed as a dependency, so we'll have to manually add it to Gemfile for now. Ruby 3.0 removed this bundled gems so you'll need to add them manually if you use them: `sdbm`, `webrick`, `net-telnet`, `xmlrpc`. Hopefully Jekyll 4.3 will have `webrick` listed as a Jekyll dependency (it is fixed in Jekyll master branch) so manually updating Gemfiles won't be needed.

## Q&A

**Q. What if I want to run other jekyll commands?**

just add the jekyll options to the end of the `bretfisher/jekyll`:

```shell
docker run -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll doctor
```
